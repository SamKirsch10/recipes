Add the 405g bread flour and 11g salt. Use a flexible spatula or bowl scraper to stir the mixture, making sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to incorporate the preferment, until a shaggy dough comes together.</li> <li>Knead the dough: Generously flour the work surface, then scrape the dough and any floury bits out of the bowl and onto the surface (reserve the bowl). Generously flour the dough. Use the heel of your hands to knead the dough, adding flour as needed if the dough is sticking to your hands or the surface, until the dough is very smooth, elastic and slightly tacky, 10 to 15 minutes. (You can also combine everything in a stand mixer and mix on low speed with the dough hook for 8 to 10 minutes, adding more flour as needed until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.)</li> <li>Test the dough: Pinch off a golf ball-size piece and flatten it with your fingertips.

For a round loaf, divide the dough in half.</li> <li> <p>Braid or twist the dough: For a braid, roll each of the 6 pieces into snakes measuring about 18 inches long and slightly tapered at the ends.

Make sure you have a couple of inches of clearance on either side of the braid so it can expand.</p> </li> <li> <p>Alternatively, for a round, roll the two pieces of dough into long snakes measuring about 28 inches long, making sure to taper the snakes at one end. Dust the strands in flour to coat them lightly, then line them up so they\u2019re side by side with the tapered ends aligned. Twist the two strands together, then start at the tapered end and roll up the twist into a tight coil, wrapping the fatter end around and tucking the end underneath the coil. Transfer the coil to a parchment-lined sheet pan.</p> </li> <li>Egg wash and proof the dough: Beat the remaining egg in a small bowl until it\u2019s streak-free. Brush the loaf with the egg, then loosely cover the dough with some lightly oiled plastic wrap on a sheet pan, and let it rise at room temperature until it\u2019s doubled in size, extremely puffy, and springs back but holds a slight indentation when poked gently with a wet finger, another 1\u00bd to 2 hours (but possibly longer, depending on ambient temperature). The dough is easy to underproof, so, if you\u2019re unsure, err on the side of overproofing. (The round loaf will also take longer to proof.) Alternatively, before proofing, you can refrigerate the dough overnight, but omit the egg wash and make sure it\u2019s covered (plastic should cover it loosely but be sealed around the pan so the dough doesn't dry out).</li> <li>Heat the oven: Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and heat it to 350 degrees.</li> <li>Bake: Uncover the challah and brush with another layer of egg wash. Sprinkle the loaf with poppy or sesame seeds (if using) and bake until the loaf is shiny and burnished, an instant-read thermometer registers 190 degrees when inserted into the center, and it sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom, 35 to 40 minutes. Let the challah cool completely on the baking sheet.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"recipes/2022/01/19/chicken-marsala/","title":"Chicken Marsala","text":""},{"location":"recipes/2022/01/19/chicken-marsala/#ingredients","title":"Ingredients","text":"<ul> <li>1 package (or two if you want left overs) of thin chicken cutlets</li> <li>2 pkgs of mushrooms- one baby Bella and one reg white button sliced</li> <li>1 bottle of Marsala wine</li> <li>1 box chicken stock</li> <li>Flour</li> </ul>"},{"location":"recipes/2022/01/19/chicken-marsala/#steps","title":"Steps","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Dredge each piece of chicken in flour that is salted and peppered(not a lot just a bit of each) shake off any excess flour. </p> </li> <li> <p>On medium heat, pan saut\u00e9 each piece in a combo of olive oil and butter/ margarine till just golden on each side.
