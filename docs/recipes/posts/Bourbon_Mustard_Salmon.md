# Bourbon Mustard Salmon


## Ingredients
* 1/2 c brown sugar
* 3 tbls boiling water
* 3 capfuls bourbon
* 3 heaping tsp country Dijon mustard
* 1/4 c soy sauce low sodium
* 2 tsp maple syrup
* Old Bay seasoning 
* Salmon


## Steps
1. Put sugar in a bowl. Add very hot water. Mix to make a paste consistency. Add rest of ingredients EXCEPT Old Bay and mix well. 

2. One hour before cooking, take salmon out of fridge and pour on 1/2 of marinade- reserving rest for later. Let salmon continue to marinate out of fridge turning salmon in marinade after 30 mins. 

3. In a super hot saut√© pan, add oil and a tsp of butter(or margarine). Sear salmon on both sides till caramelized- about 2-3 mins per side. Take each piece out of pan and place in a sprayed baking dish. 

4. Pour more marinade over and sprinkle generously with Old Bay seasoning. Broil in hot oven for 5-8 mins depending on thickness and desired temperature of salmon.

Note: because of marinade and hot hot pan, the searing process spurts. May want to use a screened lid while searing.
