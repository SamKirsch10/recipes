# Matzoh Balls


## Ingredients
* matzo ball soup mix
* matzo ball mix
* veggie oil
* eggs


## Steps
Two tablespoons veggie oil
2 Eggs room temp
One whole bag matzo ball mix


PRE) Prep water with about 2-3 inches of water and a soup mix. Get to simmering 

1. Mix ingredients it till combined and then put in fridge for 10mins (or if balls are already cooking - till current batch is done)
2. Have a bowl with water ready on the side to dip hands in so balls don’t stick. Make balls with one hand (barely forming them - the less handling the better) into roughly the size of ping pong ball
3. Drop into simmering cooking liquid and cook for 15-17mins or until they look cooked (there may be spots that still look raw - that’s fine - it’ll finish cooking at soup time) *see video1
4. Take them out and put in Tupperware
